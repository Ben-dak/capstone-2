# DELI-cious Capstone Planning Worksheet

## step 3, classes, what it knows (steps 1-3)

## Step 1: Understand the Problem
**Instructions:** In your own words, summarize what this program needs to do.

- Q: What kind of business is this for?
* A: Sandwich shop
- Q: What are customers/employees supposed to do with the application?
* A: Enter what the customer orders
- Q: What should happen after the customer finishes their order?
* A: The order and price should print

## Step 2: Identify Requirements
**Instructions:** Make a list of broad requirements based on the project description.  
Look for the key features the application must support. Use bullet points.

**Tip:** Scan the project text and highlight all the nouns and verbs—this can help identify possible classes and actions.

---

## Step 3: User Flow (What Happens First, Next, Then?)
**Instructions:** Imagine you're a customer or employee using this app from start to finish.  
Write a numbered list of the steps a typical user would take.

**GOING TO START WITH DRINK**
1. Start the program
2. Type the "New Order" option (Which will be number 1)
3. Select "Add Drink" 
4. Select whether the drink is small, medium, or large
5. Select your drink flavor
6. Select the "Checkout" option from the menu
7.

1. Start the program
2. Choose to place an order
3. Add first sandwich
4. 

## Step 4: Design Test Cases
**Instructions:** Write down at least 5 scenarios where you would want to test your program.

Include:
- A sample action (e.g., customer adds 2 sandwiches, both toasted, one with extra cheese)
- What you expect to happen (e.g., order shows correct total, receipt saves to correct location)
- Remember, we like using actual numbers and doing real calculations

**Note:** These tests will help guide your coding later.

## Step 5: Brainstorm Potential Classes
**Instructions:** Based on what the program needs to do and the nouns you found earlier, list at least 4–6 possible classes you may need.

- You are **NOT** writing code—just brainstorming.
- Once you have a list, check in with your instructor to get feedback.

---

## Step 6: Define Responsibilities
**Instructions:** For each class you listed above, write what that class might be responsible for.

Think about:
- What does this class know?
- What does this class do?

| Class Name | What it knows (data) | What it does (behavior/methods) |
|------------|----------------------|---------------------------------|
|            |                      |                                 |
|            |                      |                                 |

---

## Step 7: Relationships Between Classes
**Instructions:** Now think about how the classes relate to each other.

- Are there classes that contain or use other classes?
- Are there 1-to-many or has-a relationships?
- Inheritance? Interfaces? Abstract classes?

Write your thoughts or draw lines between classes on paper. You’ll use this in the next step.

---

## Step 8: Create a UML Diagram (Draft)
**Instructions:** Using your brainstormed classes, draw a UML diagram showing:

- Class names
- Attributes (variables)
- Methods (just the important ones)
- Relationships (e.g., arrows for associations or dependencies)

Don’t worry about being perfect—this is a draft to help guide your design.  
Present your UML diagram to your instructor for final approval. You may change it while you’re doing your Capstone but at least you have a start.
